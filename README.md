# Portfolio Analysis  
### Asset Allocation, Diversification, and Performance

This project presents a portfolio analysis focusing on **asset allocation**, **diversification**, and **risk–return performance**.  
It demonstrates how combining different asset classes can help balance risk and return over the long term.

The analysis is based on a simplified portfolio model and is intended for **educational and analytical purposes**.

## 📌 Project Motivation

Investors rarely hold a single asset.  
Different assets exhibit different risk and return characteristics, and portfolio construction aims to achieve an optimal balance between them.

This project explores:
- How asset allocation affects portfolio performance  
- Why diversification reduces overall risk  
- How rebalancing helps maintain long-term investment objectives  

---

## 🧺 Investment Universe

The portfolio consists of three broad asset categories:

- **Fixed Income** – stability and income  
- **Equity** – long-term growth  
- **Alternative Assets** – diversification benefits  

Each asset contributes differently to portfolio returns and risk.

## 🏗️ Portfolio Structure

Key assumptions and design choices:

- Strategic (long-term) asset allocation  
- Fully invested portfolio  
- Fixed target weights  
- Annual rebalancing  
- No market timing  

Portfolio weights represent **capital allocation**, not asset prices.

---

## 🔗 Diversification and Correlation

Diversification effectiveness depends on **correlation**, not just the number of assets.

The analysis shows that:
- Low or negative correlations help reduce portfolio risk  
- Some assets move together, while others do not  
- Simply adding more assets does not guarantee diversification  

Correlation matrices and scatter plots are used to illustrate these relationships.

## 📈 Portfolio Performance

Main performance characteristics:

- Positive long-term cumulative returns  
- Temporary drawdowns during periods of market stress  
- Relatively fast recovery, highlighting portfolio resilience  

Portfolio returns are calculated as the **weighted sum of individual asset returns**.

---

## ⚖️ Risk–Return Profile

The portfolio achieves:
- **Attractive annualized returns**
- **Moderate volatility**

This highlights the role of diversification in controlling risk while maintaining return potential.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Considerations

This project uses simplified assumptions:

- Stable returns, risk, and correlations over time  
- No transaction costs or taxes  
- Annual rebalancing with fixed weights  

In real markets, parameters change over time, and transaction costs can significantly affect net returns.

## 🧠 Key Conclusions

- Asset allocation is the primary driver of portfolio performance  
- Diversification enhances portfolio resilience by reducing risk  
- Strategic rebalancing helps maintain long-term objectives  
- Portfolio construction should align with investor goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions
